After adding it to your calendar through the website ([here](https://shamsical.ir/website/)) or Google's Marketplace ([here](https://workspace.google.com/u/0/marketplace/search/Shamsi%20Calendar%20%2F%20%D9%87%D8%AC%D8%B1%DB%8C%20%D8%B4%D9%85%D8%B3%DB%8C)), you should see a "Sun" logo on the right side of your [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?pli=1).  

There, you can convert your calendars to be treated with Shamsi events. I recommend having at least one additional calendar for your Shamsi events.  

I have to indicate that the purpose of this add-on is to fix the problem with repeating events based on Shamsi calendar.

Notice that you should already activate "[Alternate Calendars](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/settings?pli=1)". Set it to Persian :)
